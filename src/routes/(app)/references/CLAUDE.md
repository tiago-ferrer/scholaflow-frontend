## Data Model (`$lib/types/reference.ts`)

`Reference` has:
- Bibliographic fields: `title`, `authors`, `year`, `journal`, `doi`, `url`, `abstract`, `tags`
- `entryType: BibTexEntryType` — one of 14 BibTeX types (ARTICLE, BOOK, INPROCEEDINGS, etc.)
- Notes (inline on detail page)
- Attachments (PDF files, etc.)
- Soft delete (`deletedAt`)

## API (`$lib/api/references.ts`)

Key methods beyond standard CRUD:
- `getDownloadUrl(id, attachId)` → presigned URL for downloading/viewing a PDF attachment
- `getAnnotatedPdfUrl(id, attachId)` → presigned URL for the annotated PDF version
- `getAnnotationUrl(id, attachId)` → URL for the annotation image overlay
- `addViewer(id, payload)`, `removeViewer(id, viewerId)` — sharing/collaboration
- `addNote(id, content)`, `patchNote(id, noteId, content)`, `deleteNote(id, noteId)`

## PDF Viewing

The detail page has two PDF view modes:
- **Original** — raw uploaded PDF via presigned download URL
- **Annotated** — annotated version with an image overlay (annotation image rendered on top of the PDF)

Both views use `viewers/+page.svelte` which loads the appropriate URL from the API.

## BibTeX Import

`FromBibTexModal.svelte` parses a BibTeX string (via `$lib/utils/bibtex.ts`) and pre-fills the create form. Accessible from the "New" button on the references list.

## Trash

`GET /references/trash` (owner-only) returns soft-deleted references, most recently deleted first — a backend table Scan, not a GSI query (deleted items are absent from the sparse owner-index). Linked from `FolderTree.svelte`'s bottom "library tools" section. Restoring uses the existing `referencesApi.restore(id)`.

## Create Form

Manual form covers all bibliographic fields. `BibTexEntryType` selector determines which fields are shown/required.
